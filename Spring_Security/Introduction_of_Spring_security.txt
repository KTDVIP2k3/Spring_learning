Spring Security is a framework for securing Java applications. It provides:

Authentication – verifies user identity.

Authorization – controls access to resources.

Protection against common vulnerabilities such as CSRF, XSS, session fixation, and clickjacking.

Seamless integration with Spring Boot and Spring MVC for easy setup.

Why Use Spring Security?

Protects user data and application resources.

Offers flexible authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Helps prevent common security threats.

Supports enterprise requirements such as LDAP, OAuth2, and JWT.

Control access to pages or APIs based on roles.

Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

Session Fixation

Clickjacking

XSS (with Content Security Policies)

Integration with Spring Framework

Easy configuration via Spring Boot starter (spring-boot-starter-security).

Automatic security for web apps and APIs.

Password Management

Utilities for verifying passwords.

Method-Level Security

Annotations: @PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize, @Secured
